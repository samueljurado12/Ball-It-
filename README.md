# Ball-It!

Ball-It! is a videogame made with Unity in 2D, everything code by myself.

## Description

It is a local, multiplayer, competitive, FFA game based in three basic mechanics.
* The first one is the movement of the player, which includes a dash that makes you invulnerable.
* The second one is the first shot of the projectile, which spawn projected some distance in the direction the player is moving
* The last one is the second shot of the projectile, based on the current position of the player.

## Controls
* Left joystick to move.
* Left trigger to dash.
* Right trigger to shoot.

## Current state
This game is currently in a very early stage of development, no assets yet, neither sound. I work in it in my free time, focusing on
the coding more than the art. Everything will be totally uploaded as this is for my personal portfolio and for practice.
